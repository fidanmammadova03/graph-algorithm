# graph-algorithm
This algorithm helps to find out whether there is a route between two nodes in the given directed graph. 

•	Create a graph
•	Insert vertices
•	Check route

First step is to create a graph and then should add some edges or directions. And the final step is to check whether there is a path between two vertices.
