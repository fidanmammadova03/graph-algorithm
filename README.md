# graph-algorithm
This algorithm helps to find out whether there is a route between two nodes in the given directed graph. 

•	Create a graph
•	Insert vertices
•	Check route

First step is to create a graph and then should add some edges or directions. And the final step is to check whether there is a path between two vertices.


For example:
![A-directed-simple-graph-with-5-vertices-and-4-edges](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93821747/171271894-0af81da1-cee1-4f5c-bf85-11251838e305.png)

In this example we can say that there is a route between A and D. But there is no a route between D and B.
